# About me:
I am currently a post doctoral researcher at Emory University, Atlanta, USA. Here i am studying the levels of genome wide genetic differentiation between Eastern and Western Monarch butterfly populations. It was believed that a small populations of Monarchs are non-migratory in South Florida, Texas and Georgia. I am trying to find out the genetic basis of migration in Monarchs.

I did my PhD at Evolutionary Biology Centre, Uppsala University. I tried to understand the key forces underlying population differentiation and speciation in cryptic species of the wood white Leptidea butterflies. Using a combination of classical genetic and novel genomic tools we will try to identify and characterise the genetic regions that might have been involved in the build-up of reproductive isolation between these cryptic species of butterflies. My background and my core interests are in the field of bioinformatics and data analysis to solve biological questions.
