# A CNV (Copy Number Variant) detection app designed during my first 2 years at Devyser AB. Here is a small portion of the app. 
The app uses data generated by their internal software for Several types of genetically inherited deseases. It useses linear regression to find the correct mutation the patient has. It did a very good job finding the normal samples from the samples with problematic mutations. If a shade of red is shown in the graph that means that the sample has a mutation. If it is not shown the sample is normal. The bellow samples has a mutation called Saudi a12 with a 63% confidence.

An AI chat bot was intigrated in to the tool to check its potential to reduce the tech support cases.

# Phylogenetic relationship and divergence time estimates for 15 Lepidoptera species.
The is done during my PhD at Uppsala University for my first publication. We analysed the genome size changes in 15 butterfly species and mapped it on to the phylogenetic tree to show the per year increase in the genome size. The article can be found [**here**](https://doi.org/10.1093/gbe/evx163).

The analysis and the ploting was done using R

# Joyplots using python
This is an infographic of the year wise numbers of Monarch of monarch butterflies collected in June and July. These two months were considered the peak seasons for monarch butterflies. This was done using the NABA (North American Butterfly Association) data.
