# A CNV (Copy Number Variant) detection app designed during my first 2 years at Devyser AB. Here is a small portion of the app. 
The app uses data generated by their internal software for Several types of genetically inherited deseases. It useses linear regression to find the correct mutation the patient has. It did a very good job finding the normal samples from the samples with problematic mutations. If a shade of red is shown in the graph that means that the sample has a mutation. If it is not shown the sample is normal. The bellow samples has a mutation called Saudi a12 with a 63% confidence.
